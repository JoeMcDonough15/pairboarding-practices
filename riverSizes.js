// You are given a two-dimensional array (matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0s and 1s.
//  Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents part of a river. A river consists of any number of 1s that are either
//  horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent). The number of adjacent 1s forming a river determines its size.
// Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented in the input matrix.Â Note that these sizes
// do not need to be in any particular order.
// Sample Input:
// [
//   [1,0,0,1,0],
//   [1,0,1,0,0],
//   [0,0,1,0,1],
//   [1,0,1,0,1],
//   [1,0,1,1,0]
// ]

// Sample Output:
// => [1,2,2,2,5]

// Solution Attempt

// keep track of a visited set of nodes
// keep track of an array denoting all river sizes, initialized to an empty array
// iterate over the graph (matrix)
// for any node that has a 1 in it, and has not been visited, feed it into a helper function that will run a depth first search for any surrounding 1's
//      in that helper function, keep track of a stack that begins with the starting node passed in
//      pop the stack each iteration of a while loop (while the stack is not empty)
//      place that node in visited and use another helper function to find all the adjacent nodes (within range) to it that also have a 1
//      add those nodes to the stack if they have not been visited yet.
//      at the end of the dfs function, return the size of the current river
// push the size of that river to our allRiverSizes array, now that all its nodes have been visited and recorded
// after the nested for loop to traverse the matrix, return the array of river sizes
